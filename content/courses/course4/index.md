## Introduction

This course documentation shares my learning journey and knowledge gained from the comprehensive Docker Platform course. Docker has become the most popular container management platform in the world, with extensive adoption across companies of all sizes - from startups to enterprise-level organizations. As containerization technology becomes essential for modern software development and deployment, mastering Docker is now a mandatory skill for programmers and DevOps professionals.

Through this course, I've learned Docker from beginner to advanced level. The material is well-structured, containing both theory and practice that can be followed by programming beginners. The goal is for participants to master Docker proficiently for production environments. This Docker material contains comprehensive containerization theory along with practical implementation, allowing participants to follow the material progressively.

- **Container Fundamentals** - Understanding containerization vs virtualization concepts
- **Docker Architecture** - Container management and orchestration systems
- **Image Management** - Creating, managing, and distributing Docker images
- **Container Operations** - Deployment, monitoring, and resource management
- **Networking & Storage** - Container networking and persistent data management
